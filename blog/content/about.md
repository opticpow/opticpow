## About Me
I'm Wayne Ingram, a Unix Admin from back when workstations cost as much as a German Car. I've been in the IT field for over 20 years, and have done everything from Call Center support to Architecture, Management a period as a Fly to Site Engineer. My focus these days is more around Security, Devops practices, Automation and the Cloud.

I have an interest in all things technology related, photography, drones and home automation, with a bit of wood working thrown in for good measure.
